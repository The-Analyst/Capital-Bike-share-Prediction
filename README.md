**Description of the files:**
 1. ```code caual.R```: Contains the R code for the models developed and trained only for the casual customers. 
    
 2. ```code regd.R```: Contains the R code for the models developed and trained only for the registered customers. 
 
 3. ```Profit.R```: Contains the R code to calculate the profit generated by our ensembled model and also a comparison with the naive model used by the company as a default.
 
 4. ```day.csv```: This is the pre-processed dataset having the daily data for the year 2011 & 2012 (actual demands, weather parameters & day information). Please refer [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data) for the dataset on kaggle.
 
 5. ```Bike_data_processed.csv```: This is the processed data set used for building our models after data cleaning, feature generation and selection.
 
 6. ```pred_casual.csv``` , ```pred_regd.csv```: These are the predicted demands of different customer types (casual & registered) generated from our ensembled model, stored in CSV format.
   
 7. ```predictcasual_NN.csv``` ,  ```predictcasual_RF.csv``` ,  ```predictregd_NN.csv``` ,  ```predictregd_RF.csv```: These are the predicted demands of different customer types (casual & registered) generated from our different models (Neural network & Random forest), stored in CSV format.
    
 8. ```Team_NUCLEUS_capitalbikeshare.pdf```: This is a detailed report of the project. Please do read this file for a better understanding of the proposed solution.
